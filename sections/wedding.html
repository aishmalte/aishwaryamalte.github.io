      <p><strong>25 February, 2026 — Wedding Ceremony</strong></p>

      <p>
        The wedding ceremony will happen in the Marathi tradition, however, we would like to mix it up a bit with some western customs too. We hence curated our vision as below.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will be a morning wedding as Marathi weddings often happen in the morning.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Groom’s Entry</li>
        <li>Bride’s Entry</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The wedding ceremony will broadly be in two parts:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Part 1: Antarpat and Varmala (Garlands exchange)</li>
        <li>Part 2: Pheras and Saptapadi</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Antarpat &amp; Varmala</h3>
      <p>Details coming soon.</p>

      <h3>Pheras &amp; Saptapadi</h3>
      <p>Details coming soon.</p>
