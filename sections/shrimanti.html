        Shrimanti Pooja is a pre-wedding ritual performed to welcome the bride, groom,
        and their families to the wedding. It’s a joyful meet-and-greet ceremony where
        both sides get to know the who’s who of the couple.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shrimanti Poojan” literally translates to <em>crossing of boundaries</em> and
        coming together of two families in a sacred union. Originally a simple ceremony,
        it happens just before the wedding and marks the formal acceptance of the groom
        into the bride’s family and of the bride into the groom’s family.
      </p>

      <h3>What Happens During the Ceremony</h3>

      <p>
        The ceremony begins with the arrival of the groom’s family, where they are
        warmly welcomed by the bride’s family. This is followed by a prayer ceremony
        to the Gods and the ancestors of both families to seek blessings for the union.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a gesture of respect and welcome, the groom’s feet are washed with water —
        symbolising purity and humility — and he is presented with gifts by the bride’s
        family. The same ritual follows for the bride, after which both families offer
        blessings and goodwill to the couple.
      </p>

      <h3>The Central Ritual — Pavli</h3>

      <p>
        Central to the Shrimanti Pooja is <strong>“Pavli”</strong>, a symbolic exchange
        of sweets and gifts between family members. Coconuts are used as gifts: the
        groom’s father and the bride’s father exchange one, followed by the mothers,
        siblings, and extended relatives. This exchange symbolises acceptance and the
        commitment to nurture the newly formed alliance.
      </p>

      <h3>Prayer &amp; Blessings</h3>

      <p>
        The Pooja also includes a prayer where the bride and groom offer rice to
        Goddess Parvati (Gauri) for a prosperous married life. The bride dresses in a
        saree gifted by her parents and later changes into one from the groom’s side,
        marking the blending of families.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shrimanti Pooja is a celebration of cultural identity and heritage — a chance
        for both families to express pride in their traditions and values. Every
        element of the ritual represents the richness of diversity and the harmony of
        the alliance being formed.
