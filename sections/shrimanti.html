        Shrimanti Pooja is a pre-wedding ritual performed to welcome the bride, groom,
        and their families to the wedding. It’s a joyful meet-and-greet ceremony where
        both sides get to know the who’s who of the couple.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shrimanti Poojan” literally translates to <em>crossing of boundaries</em> and
        coming together of two families in a sacred union. Originally a simple ceremony,
        it happens just before the wedding and marks the formal acceptance of the groom
        into the bride’s family and of the bride into the groom’s family.
      </p>

      <h3>What Happens During the Ceremony</h3>

      <p>
        The ceremony begins with the arrival of the groom’s family, where they are
        warmly welcomed by the bride’s family. This is followed by a prayer ceremony
        to the Gods and the ancestors of both families to seek blessings for the union.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a gesture of respect and welcome, the groom’s feet are washed with water —
        symbolising purity and humility — and he is welcomed with some gifts by the bride’s
        family. The same ritual follows for the bride, after which both families offer
        blessings and goodwill to the couple.
      </p>

      <h3>The Central Ritual — Pavli</h3>

      <p>
        Central to the Shrimanti Pooja is <strong>“Pavli”</strong>, a symbolic exchange
        of sweets and gifts between family members. Coconuts are used as gifts: the
        groom’s father and the bride’s father exchange one, followed by the mothers,
        siblings, and extended relatives. This exchange symbolises acceptance and the
        commitment to nurture the newly formed alliance. 
      </p>

      <h3>Prayer &amp; Blessings</h3>

      <p>
        The Pooja also includes a prayer where the bride and groom offer rice to
        Goddess Parvati (Gauri) for a prosperous married life. <!--The bride dresses in a
        saree gifted by her parents and later changes into one from the groom’s side,
        marking the blending of families.-->
      </p>

      <p>
        Shrimanti Pooja is a celebration of cultural identity and heritage — a chance
        for both families to express pride in their traditions and values. Every
        element of the ritual represents the richness of diversity and the harmony of
        the alliance being formed. That is also why we feel this was an important ceremony for us. :) 
      </p>

      <h3> What after the rituals? Dance Performances!</h3>
      <p>
        One thing you can expect is dance performances! Indian weddings often have it in the evening before the wedding. 
        The Shrimanti Pooja will be followed by a reception party with dance performances from 
        friends and close family members of the bride and groom and also by the bride and groom themselves! 
        This is ofcourse voluntary to participate in, and is not expected to be perfect, but the idea is to have fun, and enjoy together. 
      </p>

      <p class="note">
      We hope you can enjoy the evening but remember to get a good sleep as the wedding will start early morning the following day.
