        Actually there is not much to know here. After all the ceremonies and rituals, it is time to just party!
        So there isn't much description for this one, but just enjoy.

      <h3> Dance Performances</h3>
      <p>
        One thing you can expect is dance performances! Indian weddings often have it in the evening before the wedding. 
        But to get good sleep for an early morning wedding, we decided to do it a bit western way, that is to combine it 
        with the reception party after the wedding. So we will start the reception party with dance performances from 
        friends and close family members of the bride and groom and also by the bride and groom themselves! 
        This is ofcourse voluntary to participate in, and is not expected to be perfect, but the idea is to have fun, and enjoy together. 

        This will be followed by dance and celebration and food and hopefully only good and lovely vibes! :)
