        The <strong>Haldi Ceremony</strong> is a cherished pre-wedding ritual in Indian weddings. 
        “Haldi” literally translates to <em>turmeric</em> — the star of the day — and sets the tone 
        for a celebration of warmth, laughter, and blessings. The dress code is traditionally 
        yellow, matching the vibrance of the ritual itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turmeric holds great <strong>auspicious and cultural significance</strong> in Indian traditions. 
        It symbolizes purity, prosperity, and good health. For centuries, it has been valued for its 
        <em>medicinal</em> and <em>beautifying properties</em>, acting as a natural antiseptic that 
        leaves the skin glowing — a fitting ritual before the wedding day.

        The paste is typically made using turmeric, rose water, chickpea flour, and sometimes milk or yogurt — 
        <strong>all natural ingredients</strong> symbolizing purity and simplicity. No cosmetics, only blessings!
      </p>

      <h3>The Joyful Ritual</h3>
      <p>
        During the ceremony, family members and friends apply the haldi paste to the bride and groom, 
        offering blessings and good wishes for a prosperous and happy married life. The atmosphere is 
        filled with laughter, music, and joy as everyone joins in the fun.

      <p>
        As the ceremony unfolds, it often takes a playful turn — guests shower the couple with flower petals, 
        and sometimes, in the end, with a splash of water! The ritual signifies cleansing, renewal, and 
        preparation for the sacred wedding ahead.

        <strong>Tip:</strong> Expect to get a little messy — but that’s the fun of it! The Haldi ceremony 
        is all about celebration, connection, and radiant beginnings.
