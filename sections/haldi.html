        Haldi ceremony is a typical pre-wedding ritual in Indian weddings. Haldi literally translates to turmeric and this is because it is all about the turmeric paste as you will see! Hence all the dress code is often yellow - for one to echo the spirit of Haldi and mostly to protect your clothes from the color of Haldi!

        “Turmeric” has a very auspicious significance in Indian culture and has been anciently quite central to the culture. Culturally the color signifies prosperity. From ancient times, turmeric has been acknowledged for its medicinal values as well as an antiseptic for the skin.

        The turmeric paste is often made with turmeric, rose water, chick pea flower, and possibly milk or yogurt, so no cosmetics!

        The ceremony typically consists of meeting together and applying turmeric on the bride and groom to wish them the best.

        <strong>Tip:</strong>  Expect the ceremony to take a enjoyable turn as the turmeric part is often followed by showering the bride and groom with flower petals and at the end also with some water. In essence, it is like getting them ready for the wedding!
